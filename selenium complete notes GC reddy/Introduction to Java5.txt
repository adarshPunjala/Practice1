Class Notes:
Selenium Class 6: Introduction to Java
------------------------------------------
i) Introducing Java Programming Language

ii) Java Environment Setup

iii) Java Program Structure/Java Syntax
------------------------------------------------
i) Introducing Java Programming Language
------------------------------------------------
> Java Programming Language was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, Now it is 
subsidiary of Oracle corporation.

> Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language, In Java everything is object, Java
can be easily extended since it is based on the object model.

> Java is a Platform independent language, It can be compiled and interpreted.

> Java is Simple easy to learn and implement.

> Java is Securable, Using Java we can develop virus free and tamper free systems.
---------------
Usage of Java
------------------
> Developing Desktop Applications (Ex: Acrobat Reader)

> Developing web Applications

> Developing Enterprise Application (Ex: Banking, Insurance Applications etc...)

> Developing Mobile Applications

> Developing Embedded Systems.

> Smart Cards

> Games software etc...
----------------------
> Test Automation

Java Syntax
-------------
> Java is case sensitive language

> First letter of Class Name should be in Upper case

> Method names should start with lower case letter.

> Java program file name should exactly match with class name.

> Java Program execution starts from main method, which is mandatory in every Java program.

> Every Statement should end with semi colon symbol.

> Code blocks enclosed with {}
------------------------------------------------
ii) Java Environment Setup
------------------------------------------------
Steps:

> Download Java Software (JDK) and Install.

> Set Environment Variable (Path Variable).

> Download Eclipse IDE and Extract.
-------------------------------------
In Computer Programming we have Three steps

i) Writing a Program.

ii) Compiling the Program

iii) Run /Execute the Program

Step 1: Writing a Program.

public class Sample{
public static void main(String [] args) {
System.out.println ("Hello Java World");
}
}
-----------------------
Step 2: Compiling the Program

Change to Java program file directory.

Type javac Sample.java

(* it creates Java class file)
----------------------------------
Step 3: Run /Execute the Java program

Type java Sample
------------------------------------------------
In Test Automation using Selenium, we use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like
Eclipse IDE.

> Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

> Eclipse IDE is a platform to create and Run /execute programs like Java, Perl, Python,
Ruby, PHP etc...

> Eclipse IDE is open source (eclipse Public License)

It provides Editor, help for Syntax, context help, auto compilation, debugging etc....
----------------------------------------------
Download Eclipse IDE and Extract.

Write and Execute a Java program using Eclipse IDE

Steps:

> Launch Eclipse IDE

> Create Java Project

> Create Java Package

> Create Java Class

Write java code in the Class file and Run
