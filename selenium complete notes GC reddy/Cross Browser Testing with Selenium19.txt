Selenium Class 22: Cross Browser Testing using Selenium WebDriver
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) What is Cross Browser Testing?

Cross Browser Testing is a type of Test to check that our Web Application works as expected in different Browsers.

2) Why Cross Browser Testing?

A web application can be opened in any web browser by the end user, So we need to ensure that the web application will work as expected in all popular browsers.
-----------------------------------
3) Popular Browsers

a) Google Chrome: It was released in 2008, its market share approximately 68%

b) Mozilla Firefox: It was released in 2004, its market share approximately 19%

c) Internet Explorer: It was released in 1995, its market share approximately 6.5%
------------------------------------------
4) Working with different Browsers.

> Selenium WebDriver supports Browser compatibility tests on almost every popular browser, including Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera and Safari.

> The WebDriver API drives the web browser as the real user would drive it.

> By default, Firefox driver comes with selenium-serverstanalone.jar library added.

> For Chrome, IE, Safari, Opera, there are libraries that need to be instantiated externally.
-----------------------------------------------
5) How to conduct Cross Browser Testing using Selenium WebDriver?

a) Element Locators - Same for all Browsers.

b) WebDriver Methods/Commands -Same for all Browsers.

c) Programming features (Java/C#/Python/Perl/Ruby/PHP) - Same for all Browsers.

d) JUnit / TestNG Annotations - Same for all Browsers.

e) Browser Driver - various from one browser to another.

Note: For Mozilla Firefox, just create the driver, For other browsers, libraries that need to be instantiated externally.
---------------------------------
f) Inspect Elements -

For Mozilla Firefox -Built in feature Page Inspector,
(Firebug and Firepath)

For Chrome and IE - Built in Developer tools
---------------------
--------------------------------------------------------
6) Create Browser Drivers

(For Google Chrome, IE and Other Browsers, download Browser drivers and set path in Selenium Test Scripts)

a) Mozilla Firefox Browser:

WebDriver driverName = new FirefoxDriver();

b) Google Chrome

//Instantiate Chrome Browser driver

System.setproperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "driver .exe file path");
WebDriver driverName = new ChromeDriver();

c) IE Browser driver

System.setproperty("webdriver.ie.driver", "driver .exe file path");
WebDriver driverName = new InternetExplorerDriver();
------------------------------------------------------
7) Create a Test Case and Execute using Mozilla Firefox, Chrome and IE Browsers.

Test Case: Verify Launch Application (Google) functionality in Firefox, Chrome and IE Browsers.

Steps:
i) Launch the Browser
ii) Navigate to https://www.google.com url

Verification point:
Capture the page Title (Actual) and Compare with Expected.

Expected Page Title: 
--------------------------------
a) Test Case for Mozilla Firefox Browser

WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
driver.get("https://www.google.com");

String PageTitle = driver.getTitle();

if (PageTitle.equals("Google")){
System.out.println("Google Application Launched - Passed");
}
else {
System.out.println("Google Application Not Launched -Failed"); 
}
driver.close();
------------------------------
b) Test Case for Google Chrome Browser

System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "E:\\chromedriver.exe");
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver.get("https://www.google.com");

String PageTitle = driver.getTitle();

if (PageTitle.equals("Google")){
System.out.println("Google Application Launched - Passed");
}
else {
System.out.println("Google Application Not Launched -Failed"); 
}
driver.close();
------------------------------
c) Test Case for internet Explorer browser

System.setProperty("webdriver.ie.driver", "E:\\IEDriverServer.exe");
WebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();
driver.get("https://www.google.com");

String PageTitle = driver.getTitle();

if (PageTitle.equals("Google")){
System.out.println("Google Application Launched - Passed");
}
else {
System.out.println("Google Application Not Launched -Failed"); 
}
driver.close();
--------------------------------------
8) Create a Test Case and Execute using Mozilla Firefox, Chrome and IE Browsers Continuously.

public class TestCase1 {
public static WebDriver driver;
public static int browser;
public static String BrowserName;

public static void main(String[] args) {

for (browser = 1; browser <= 3; browser++){
if (browser == 1) {
driver = new FirefoxDriver();
BrowserName = "Mozilla Firefox Browser: ";
}
else if (browser == 2) {
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "E:\\chromedriver.exe");
driver = new ChromeDriver();
BrowserName = "Google Chrome Browser: ";
}
else if (browser == 3){
System.setProperty("webdriver.ie.driver", "E:\\IEDriverServer.exe");
driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();
BrowserName = "Internet Explorer Browser: ";
}
driver.get("https://www.google.com");

String PageTitle = driver.getTitle();

if (PageTitle.equals("Google")){
System.out.println(BrowserName + " - Google Application Launched - Passed");
}
else {
System.out.println(BrowserName + " - Google Application Not Launched -Failed"); 
}
driver.close();
}
}
}
